## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,  I'm **Xiang Zhang** \(**å¼ ç¿”**\)

ðŸ”­ I am currently working as a RA in Hengqin Lab.

ðŸ“‘ [C.V.](https://simmzx.github.io/XiangZhang_CV_20250924.pdf) ðŸ“« **Email**: zhangxiang@simm.ac.cn

ðŸ˜„ I obtained my master's degree at Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica & NJUCM, advised by [Prof. Mingyue Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=vzBQN8EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr. Xutong Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UMWyDZAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests are focused on **developing artificial intelligence methods for organic synthesis planning & lead compound discovery, and creating tool websites for them.**

> ðŸŒ± My Representative Works 
* **SynFrag**: A chemist-like synthetic accessibility online platform, performed fragment assembly autogressive generation pre-training on a 9.18M dataset. [Web](https://synfrag.simm.ac.cn) | [DOI](https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-33251) | [Github](https://github.com/simmzx/SynFrag) 
* **BioCLIP**: A comprehensive model for predicting lead's multiple properties including ADMET, DTI, MoA, pre-trained in a progressive tri-modal bootstrapping contrastive learning framework. [Github](https://github.com/simmzx/BioCLIP)
* **AttFpPost**: A molecular property prediction method addressing the overconfidence in out-of-distribution samples. AttFpPost enhances accuracy and efficiency across diverse drug discovery scenarios by integrating normalizing flow. \[[_Patterns_](https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(24)00106-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2666389924001065%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)\] | [Github](https://github.com/simmzx/AttFpPost)
